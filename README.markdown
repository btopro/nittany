Drupal Nittany Distribution
==============
Nittany is a distribution maintained by the Penn State Drupal community, primarily designed to be a "starting point" for building sites as well as a series of supportable best practices for Drupal. By bundling a list of commonly-used and recommended modules, Nittany is intended to lessen the burden on new developers and site builders, by being a response to the question: "I installed Drupal, now what?". If you are building a new Drupal site, or are new to Drupal, you should try starting with Nittany.

Using Nittany, you can begin creating site features and functionality more quickly than with Drupal core alone.

###Install locally (and quickly) with Vagrant
The fastest way to get Nittany up and running on your local computer is with Vagrant.
 There is a repository dedicated to providing an optimal development environment while using Nittany. Download the [Nittany Vagrant repo](https://github.com/btopro/nittany-vagrant) to try it out. This is a vastly prefered method to running MAMP, WAMP, XAMP, etc for local development. Its also a good way to quickly try out Drupal and Nittany.

###Goals of Nittany
1. Help spread Drupal usage through inclusion of best practices and community trends
2. Provide a common, agreed upon set of modules that the community supports and is knowledgeable about
3. Out of the box accessibility improvements, especially associated with content entry
4. A highly accessible, responsive base theme for creating mobile capable sites rapidly
5. Provide a base of commonly installed modules that help improve site building user experience

###Installation and Usage
Install Nittany as you would any Drupal distribution, and feel free to enable, disable, install, and uninstall modules and themes. Play with it, use it to learn more about what the included modules do, or use it to begin building public facing sites. If you find a module or theme that you feel should be included in Nittany, please submit a request to the issue queue.

###Upgrading and Versioning
Version numbers are unimportant and sequential. So: 7.x-1.3 follows 7.x-1.2, and each newer version of the distribution is simply the next iteration.

Because of the number of projects included in Nittany, and the often rapid pace of development on these projects, it is impossible to guarantee that the latest versions of each project will always be included in the latest version of Nittany. What this means is that frequently when you install Nittany, modules may be reported as having available updates. We'll do our best to ensure that the recommended version of Nittany is updated monthly.

Once installed, we recommend that you upgrade and maintain components of Nittany as you would with any Drupal installation.
